    // then events bubble back up, meaning the event callback is applied to the innermost element first, then bubbles to each parent in turn.
    // if other parents handle this event, their callback will be called too

    // Event bubbling can be stopped with 
    e.stopPropagation();
  }

  // In add event listener, capture property in object indicates that the event callback should be executed when capturing event (not when bubbling).
  // This will apply the callback in reverse order, unless the stopPropagation method is called.

  // The once property indicates the event should unbind itself once after initial capture, which implies the callback will only be executed the first // time the event is raised.
