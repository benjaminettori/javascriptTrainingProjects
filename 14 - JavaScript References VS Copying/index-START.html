    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    const team = players;

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    team[3] = 'Ben';

    // now here is the problem!
    console.log(players);
    console.log(team);

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // There are several ways to take a copy

    const team2 = players.slice();
    const team3 = [].concat(players);


    team2[3] = 'Ben';
    team3[3] = 'Judi';
    console.log(team2, team3);

    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    const team4 = [...players];
    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    team4[3] = 'Spread';
    team5[3] = 'Array.from';

    console.log(team4, team5);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    const person = {
        name: 'Benjamin Ettori',
        age: '88'
    }

    // with Objects

    // and think we make a copy:

    const person2 = person;

    person2.number = '90';

    console.log(person, person2);

    person.social = {
        twitter: 'twitter',
        facebook: 'facebook'
    };

    // if we modify property in person2 we also modify property in person

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const person3 = Object.assign({}, person);

    // JSON methods are the only way to perform deep clone without specialized methods.

    const person4 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));

    person3.number = 'Object.assign';
    person3.social.twitter = 'Modified social object';

    person4.number = 'JSON';
    person4.social.twitter = 'Modified twitter property only';

    console.log(person3, person4);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
